DONUT CHART:

donut chart where each segment represents an item category. The size of each segment corresponds to the total sales within that category, segmented by fat content.

This visual can help you quickly see which categories have higher sales and how fat content affects sales.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Clustered Bar Chart:

This clustered bar chart will allow you to compare different item categories based on metrics like total sales, average sales, number of items sold, and average rating, segmented by fat content. It provides a clear, comparative view of the performance of different categories.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Line Chart:

 This line chart will allow you to observe trends in total sales over the years, broken down by outlet. It can help you identify patterns, such as which outlets are consistently performing well or if there are any particular years with noticeable sales changes.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
DOnut Chart:

This donut chart will allow you to see the distribution of total sales across different outlet sizes. Each segment of the donut represents a different outlet size, and the size of each segment corresponds to the total sales for that size.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Funnel Chart:

The funnel chart will display the total sales by outlet location, with each section of the funnel representing a different location and the size of each section corresponding to the total sales. This visualization helps in understanding which locations are generating the most sales and identifying areas for potential growth.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Matrix table:
This matrix chart will allow you to compare multiple metrics across different outlet types, providing a comprehensive view of performance indicators such as total sales, average sales, average rating, item visibility, and the number of items sold.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Slicers :

Using these slicers, users can easily filter the data based on different outlet locations, sizes, and item types, making the dashboard more dynamic and insightful.

This setup enhances the user experience by allowing for quick and easy data exploration and analysis.
